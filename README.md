# This Sentence Has Five Words

In early spring of 2016, I saw this image make the social media rounds through my writer friends' feeds:

It seemed like it would be a fun small project to make a website that did this for people.

## Credits:

The words are from [Gary Provost](http://www.garyprovost.com/), an author of many genres of books (young adult, true crime, nonfiction), and a teacher of writing.  [This page](http://www.aerogrammestudio.com/2014/08/05/this-sentence-has-five-words/) says they're specifically "as quoted in Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer by Roy Peter Clark".

I can't figure out who made the original image:  [Tineye suggests](https://www.tineye.com/search/b22a54770ff2edf9bc3e723ae66268365b49a162/?sort=crawl_date&order=asc) that it came out of Tumblr, and if anyone is good at tracking, I'd love to hear more.
